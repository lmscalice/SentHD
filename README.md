# Sentiment HDC:

This GitHub holds the executed Jupyter notebooks containing the code and results for the proposed methods in my thesis "A Study of Hyperdimensional Computing in Sentiment Analysis." This thesis was submitted in partial fulfillment of requirements for a Master of Science in Computer Engineering from Villanova University. These methods were performed on the Stanford Sentiment140 Twitter dataset found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140 and the Stanford Large Movie Review dataset found here: https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/

**N-Gram Approach:**
* For the Sentiment140 Twitter Dataset: *NGRAM_METHOD_0_RESULTS.ipynb*
* For the Movie Review Dataset: *NGRAM_METHOD_1_RESULTS.ipynb*

**Bag-of-Words Approach:**
* For the Sentiment140 Twitter Dataset: *VECTORIZED_METHOD_0_RESULTS.ipynb*
* For the Movie Review Dataset: *VECTORIZED_METHOD_1_RESULTS.ipynb*

**Lexicon-Based Approach:**
* For the Sentiment140 Twitter Dataset: *LEXICON_METHOD_0_RESULTS.ipynb*
* For the Movie Review Dataset: *LEXICON_METHOD_1_RESULTS.ipynb*

To replicate these experiments or re-run these files, an Anaconda environemnt needs to be created. The following file can be run to create the same environment these files were run in: *environment-package-list.txt*
